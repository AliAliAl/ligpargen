# How to use LigParGen?

## What is LigParGen?
LigParGen is a webbased service that provides force field (FF) parameters for organic molecule or ligands, offered by Jorgensen group.

LigParGen provides OPLS-AA force field parameters for modeling bonds, angles, torsions and Lennard-Jones interactions, and uses 1.14*CM1A charges for modeling electrostatic interactions

One can obtain topology and parmeter files from SMILES code or by uploading mol/pdb files of the ligand. 

**Supported input file formats: PDB, MOL, SMILES**

LigParGen can deal with molecules as big as Linezoloid shown in Figure 1.
